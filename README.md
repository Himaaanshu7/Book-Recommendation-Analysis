# Book Recommendation Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering with cosine similarity. It processes a sparse matrix of user-book interactions to generate personalized book recommendations.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering-based recommendation
- Uses cosine similarity to find similar users
- Generates top book recommendations for each user
- Outputs results as a CSV file

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (for nearest neighbors and similarity calculations)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **LibSVM format** (for sparse matrix storage)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommendation-analysis.git
